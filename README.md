**Title: Proposal for a Partnership on Upwork**

**Hello,**

I hope you're doing well! I’m reaching out to propose a partnership that could benefit both of us. I’m an experienced freelancer on Upwork, but my account has recently been blocked. I’d like to explore a collaboration with you to continue my work.

### What I Propose
I would like to use your Upwork account to carry on my freelancing activities. In return, I can offer you $100 per month or 10% of my monthly earnings from the account—whichever is higher. This way, you can earn extra income while I keep working.

### How It Works
To ensure your account remains secure, I will remotely access your computer using a program like AnyDesk. This allows me to work without logging in from my own location.

### Benefits of This Partnership
1. **Steady Income for You:** You’ll receive regular payments without lifting a finger.
2. **Proven Experience:** I have a strong track record of delivering quality work and maintaining good relationships with clients.
3. **Earning Potential:** With my experience and established client base, my earnings may exceed the flat rate, giving you more profit.

### Addressing Your Concerns
1. **Account Security:** I will implement secure practices, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication, and keep you updated on all activities.
2. **Upwork Policies:** I will adhere strictly to Upwork’s terms of service to ensure all actions are ethical and professional.
3. **Transparency:** You will have full visibility of earnings and activities on the account.

### Conclusion
I believe this partnership can be mutually beneficial. With my expertise, we can create a reliable income source for you while I continue my work. I’m excited about the potential of collaborating with you!

If you’re interested or have questions, please feel free to reach out.
